# TODO: Ask the model to provide a reasoning as well, and output should be in the JSON format with keys "rating" and "reasoning". Actually qwen model gave a reasonable answers, they are not all straight 5s, and What I know is that it has reasoning turned on, so maybe that affects the process.
# there is an inacuracy in the system prompt, as we ask it to provide a number, but N/A is also an option in some tasks.

# the llama70B itself doesn't follow instructions. it said that a response followed instructions
# I can try to merge the task instructions into the system prompt.
