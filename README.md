# Active UltraFeedback

**Active UltraFeedback** is a scalable pipeline for generating high-quality preference datasets to align large language models (LLMs), requiring only a set of prompts as input.

It leverages **uncertainty quantification** and **active learning** to identify and annotate the most informative samples, drastically reducing annotation costs while maintaining high data quality. Annotations are provided by an oracle (typically another LLM, but can also be a human).

## üîÅ Pipeline Overview

Given a batch of prompts, the following steps are executed:

1. **Response Generation**: For each prompt in the batch, call multiple LLMs to each generate a response to the prompt.
2. **Uncertainty-Aware Reward Prediction**: An uncertainty-aware reward model predicts the reward and associated uncertainty of the responses for each prompt.  <br />
**Note**: This reward model is initialzied randomly in the beginning. 
3. **Pair Selection (Acquisition Function)**: Select which two responses should get (preference) annotated based on the rewards and uncertainties, using an acquisition function, e.g. Double Thompson Sampling.
4. **Oracle Annotation**: Annotate which response in the selected pairs is preferred (e.g., via another LLM or human feedback).
5. **Reward Model Training**: Train the uncertainty-aware reward model on the new preference data, then repeat the loop.

## üöÄ Quickstart

### 1. Installation

Install the package in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Running the Pipeline

Run the main dataset generation script:

```bash
python path/to/main_script.py  
```

### 3. Configuration (Optional)
To modify the pipeline parameters and steps, edit the configuration files in the `config/` directory. A quick overview:

## üõ† Environment Setup

You can use **Docker/Podman** (recommended) or **Conda** (for local development).

### Option 1: Docker/Podman (Recommended)

Build the container image:

```bash
podman build -t activeuf:latest .
```

### Option 2: Conda (For Local Use)

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate activeuf
```
