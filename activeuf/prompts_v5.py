# TODO: Ask the model to provide a reasoning as well, and output should be in the JSON format with keys "rating" and "reasoning". Actually qwen model gave a reasonable answers, they are not all straight 5s, and What I know is that it has reasoning turned on, so maybe that affects the process.

# the llama70B itself doesn't follow instructions. it said that a response followed instructions
# I can try to merge the task instructions into the system prompt.
# Basically asking the model to reason stopped llama from outputing 5 only. Now rarely but it happens that we see 4s.

  - <RESPONSE 1>...</RESPONSE 1> through <RESPONSE {model_count}>...</RESPONSE {model_count}>  - each model's response

Procedure:
  1. Read <INSTRUCTIONS> and fully understand its goals and constraints.  
  2. Score each <RESPONSE i> on a 1-5 scale using the given rubric (1 = worst, 5 = best).  
  3. Sort model indices by score in **descending** order (highest score first). Break ties by overall clarity and completeness.  
  4. **Output must be exactly**:
     
     ```
